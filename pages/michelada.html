          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <p>
            A <em>michelada</em>, when made well, is one of the most refreshing and bracingly flavorful summer beer drinks out there. It's made from a mixture of cold light beer, fresh lime juice, hot sauce, and a savory ingredient like Worcestershire sauce, and the secret is all in striking the right balance. This version goes for a bold acidity and noticeable heat, but you can play with the ratios to get it just the way you like it. Some recipes also call for tomato juice, which can sometimes be good, but we've found the most solid basic renditions omit it.

            <ol>
              <li>
                Pour Tajín (or other chili-salt mixture) or salt into a small, shallow dish in an even layer. Rub a pint or pilsner glass's rim with the cut side of the reserved juiced lime half, then dip glass into the dish to create a salt rim.
              </li>
              <li>
                Set glass right side up and fill with lime juice, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce. Add a pinch or two of salt, fill glass with ice, and top with beer. Stir gently if you want to mix it up a bit. Serve with remaining beer, topping up as you drink.
